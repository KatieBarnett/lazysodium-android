	<string name="text_intro">
		Lazysodium is an effortless and easy-to-use open-source cryptography library for Java and Android.
		It\'s based on Libsodium, which is an excellent audited open-source C cryptography library.
		\n\nThis app\'s purpose is to show you the capabilities of Lazysodium for Android and Libsodium.

	<string name="symmetric_intro">
		Symmetric key encryption means that you encrypt and decrypt a message
		using one key. It\'s faster and less complicated than asymmetric
		key encryption, which usually requires at least 4 keys.
	</string>

	<string name="asymmetric_intro">
		Asymmetric key encryption means you can encrypt using a public-private keypair.
		You can publish your keypair\'s public key to anyone and they can
		use it to encrypt messages to you, which only you can decrypt.
	</string>

	<string name="generic_hash_intro">
		Generic hashing hashes a given string or a file. You can supply
		a key making a deterministic hash too.
	</string>

	<string name="pw_hash_intro">
		Using Argon2, we can securely hash a password. Use this
		instead of Generic Hashing to create theoretically unbreakable password hashes.
	</string>


	<string name="key_derivation_intro">
		You can create several subkeys from one master key. This can
		help with key organisation, and in some cases, security.
